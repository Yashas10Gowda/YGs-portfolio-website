# Portfolio Website

This is the source code of my portfolio website hosted at [https://yashasgowda.web.app/](https://yashasgowda.web.app/).

## Getting started

Install nodejs and npm before cloning this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/Yashas10Gowda/YGs-portfolio-website.git
```

### Running the project

Once you have created the project, install dependencies and run the project in development mode:

```bash
cd my-app
npm install # or yarn
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Open it and click around.

You now have a fully functional Sapper project! To get started developing, consult [sapper.svelte.dev](https://sapper.svelte.dev).


## Directory structure

Sapper expects to find two directories in the root of your project —  `src` and `static`.


### src

The [src](src) directory contains the entry points for your app — `client.js`, `server.js` and (optionally) a `service-worker.js` — along with a `template.html` file and a `routes` directory.


#### src/routes

This is the heart of your Sapper app. There are two kinds of routes — *pages*, and *server routes*.

**Pages** are Svelte components written in `.svelte` files. When a user first visits the application, they will be served a server-rendered version of the route in question, plus some JavaScript that 'hydrates' the page and initialises a client-side router. From that point forward, navigating to other pages is handled entirely on the client for a fast, app-like feel. (Sapper will preload and cache the code for these subsequent pages, so that navigation is instantaneous.)


#### src/node_modules/@sapper

This directory is managed by Sapper and generated when building. It contains all the code you import from `@sapper` modules.


### static

The [static](static) directory contains static assets that should be served publicly. Files in this directory will be available directly under the root URL, e.g. an `image.jpg` will be available as `/image.jpg`.

The default [service-worker.js](src/service-worker.js) will preload and cache these files, by retrieving a list of `files` from the generated manifest:

```js
import { files } from '@sapper/service-worker';
```

If you have static files you do not want to cache, you should exclude them from this list after importing it (and before passing it to `cache.addAll`).
